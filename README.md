# Covid-19 Tracker

Stats and analysis of the COVID-19 outbreak.

Initial analysis tracks daily cases by local and unitary authority level 
and ranks neighbourhood in terms of percentage of the population affected. 

Key issues are that testing is not wide spread. Some doctors may be requesting
more test and finding more patients for example.
